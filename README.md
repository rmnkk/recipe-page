## Overview

I have built the page using Vue. There wasn't any need to use Vue or any other front-end framework, but I have used it because it's the most comfortable tool for me. Furthermore, I haven't deployed Vite-based apps to GitHub pages yet, so it was another reason to use Vue.

## My process

### Built with

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Custom Css Properties [Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

### What I learned

I have learnt how to deploy Vue Vite-based app to both GitHub Pages and Vercel. I have used official Vite documentation for the [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages). I have used "GitHub Actions" as a source of deployment. Configurations file for GitHub Actions with pnpm is [here](https://github.com/rmnkk/recipe-page/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/static.yml).
